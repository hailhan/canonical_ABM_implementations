# canonical_ABM_implementations
This repository contains recreations of four canonical Agent-Based Models (the SOP, the SIR, Axelrod's culture model, and SugarScape), implemented in Python's Mesa library. The models included here are not included in Mesa's examples at this time. The models here are intended to be inspiration for the midterm assignment for MACSS 40550.

Dependencies:
Mesa v. 3.1.5
